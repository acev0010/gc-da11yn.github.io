## Planning the meeting/event

Every meeting/event is different and each participant has different needs. These guidelines will be helpful for organizing meetings and small events.

<p>
	For larger events, like conferences and summits, there will be additional
	considerations. The guide,
	<a href="https://intranet.canada.ca/hr-rh/ve/dee-deme/piae-peia-eng.asp"
		>Planning Inclusive and Accessible Events &ndash; A Handbook for Federal
		Public Servants (ODI) <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i
		><span class="wb-inv"> Internal link</span></a
	>
	should be referred to when planning large events.
</p>

- The most important part of organizing an accessible meeting/event is maintaining open, clear and respectful communication between all parties.
- Service providers are highly-trained and skilled professionals. Many of them have long histories of working with ESDC and its stakeholders, it is important to maintain a positive working relationship.
- Accessibility services do not necessarily require a statement of work, if they are generic services and not specialised. It is possible to accept a quote and pay using a corporate credit card.

## Prior to meeting or event

- Accessible by Design from the start: meeting/event planners are encouraged to consider accessibility from the start, and not implement it after the fact.
- In the meeting invite always indicate that employees who require accommodations, such as: Sign Language Interpreters (SLI), Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART is a Real-time speech-to-text translation of all spoken words and environmental sounds), large fonts, etc., should contact the organizer as soon as possible in order to ensure availability of services.

- Accommodation requests sent to the organizer should have a deadline to ensure the accommodations can be secured with enough notice, and that service providers will be available.

- If participants do require accommodations, follow-up to confirm if they will be providing their own or if they would like you to arrange services. Ask if they have a preferred service provider.

- Provide multiple methods to join the meeting such as dial-in, web, and mobile devices.
- Schedule health breaks for longer meetings and ensure they occur on time.

- These are helpful for participants that may need to take medication, have a break for their service dog, self-care, and more.

- Participants may not feel comfortable sharing their disabilities with organizers, and not want their information to be shared or used elsewhere. To ensure participants feel comfortable to request the accommodations they need, provide them with a link to the privacy policy [ESDC Consultation and engagement activities privacy notice statement.](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/transparency/consultation-privacy-policy.html)
- For an open-door type meeting where you have no way of knowing the needs of your participants, then you should provide as many accommodations as possible, including but not limited to simultaneous English/French translation, CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation), sign language interpreters in both American Sign Language (ASL – English) and Langue des signes québécoise (LSQ – French). You will need to secure official language interpretation (English – French) if you expect to have both languages spoken during the event.

- Please see [CART services and Sign Language Interpreters (SLI)](./cart-services-and-sign-language-interpreters-sli.md) for additional information regarding CART services and SLI.

- Note that adding multiple accommodation features may increase technical complexity (e.g. need for multiple channels for simultaneous interpretation), if special accommodations are required please contact us by [opening a request.](https://a11yrmt.ca/openrequest-en.php)

- Ensure all meeting-related emails, documents, and presentations are accessible and sent to participants and to all service providers at least one week prior to the meeting.

- Consult [Accessible Documents - ESDC / IT Accessibility Office](https://bati-itao.github.io/resources/accessible-documents-en.html) for additional information on creating accessible documents.

- For bilingual meetings send the unilingual documents/presentations (one in English and one in French) one week prior to participants and to all service providers. The presentations should also include the translated speaker notes as well as the alternative text.

- Please see [Official Languages (OL) recommendations](./Official-languages-recommendations) for additional information regarding Official Languages recommendations.
